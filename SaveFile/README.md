# SaveFile Folder

Place your Tomodachi Life save file here.

Instructions

1. Copy your Tomodachi Life save file to this folder
2. The file should be named something like `savedataArc.txt` or have a `.txt` or `.sav` extension
3. Run the extraction script from the `Tomodachi-Life-Data-Extractor` folder

The script will automatically detect and use the save file from this folder.
If you have multiple save files, the script will use the first one it finds.
